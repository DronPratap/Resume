        <p>This is the <b>most famous sport</b> of the World.</p>
        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
            Unqualified,
            the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.
            Sports
            commonly
            called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United
            States, and
            sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football
            (specifically
            American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league
            football;
            and
            rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are
            known
            as "football codes".</p>

        <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different
            parts of the world.
            Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public
            schools
            during the 19th
            century, itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British
            Empire
            allowed these
            rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled empire.[7] By the
            end
            of the 19th
            century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately
            incorporated the rules
            of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, the Football League was
            founded in England,
            becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the
            various
            kinds of football
            grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>

            <h2>Etemology</h2>
            <p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is widely assumed that the
                word
                "football" (or the phrase
                "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative explanation,
                which
                is
                that football originally
                referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot.[14] There is no conclusive
                evidence
                for either explanation.</p>
